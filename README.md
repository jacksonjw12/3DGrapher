<h3><u>An Online 3D Grapher</u></h3></br>
I'm a multivariable calculus student who is angry there is not readily availabe online 3d grapher.
Heres a mostly finished Online Equation Parser and Grapher.

Currently the form of equation must be z = f(x,y)</br>
<b>ex: z=sin(x/100 +15*t)*20+sin(y/20+t*15)*20</b>

Controls to move around equation are WASD and arrow keys


Little easter egg: use t as a variable in order for cool function movement
